 * is that of whatever the AudioDecoder is outputting.  Note that we can't

 * between sample counts and byte counts.  Only one is sufficient at the moment
 * because the resampler only converts from planar to packed.  If the Resampler
 * ever does more, separate input and output conversions may be necessary.
