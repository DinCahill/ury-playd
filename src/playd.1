.\"=============
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\"=============
.Nm
is a very simple audio playback program, intended to be driven by other, more
complex software.  Think of it as
.Xr mpd 1 ,
but on a diet.

.Nm
has a very simple feature list: it can load one audio file (given its path), it
can play that file, it can pause playback of that file, it can seek and eject
that file, and it periodically sends back the current position in that file.
It is controlled via a simple, line-of-text-based protocol exposed as a TCP
server.

If supplied with zero arguments,
.Nm
enumerates the possible values for the
.Ar device-id
argument.  Otherwise, it is launched according to the provided arguments, the
meaning of which is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "device-id"
.It Ar device-id
The ID of the device onto which
.Nm
will output audio.  This must be one of the values provided when
.Nm
is executed with zero arguments.  Additionally, it must refer to a device
capable of audio output.
.It Ar address
If provided, this specifies the TCP/IP address to which
.Nm
will bind when listening for client connections.  Typical values include
127.0.0.1 (connections from localhost only) and 0.0.0.0 (connections from
anywhere).  The default is 127.0.0.1.
.It Ar port
If provided, this specifies the TCP/IP port on which
.Nm
will listen for client connections.  The default is 1350.
.El
.\"----------
.Ss Protocol
.\"----------
.Nm
speaks a simple, text-based protocol based heavily on POSIX-style shell
languages:
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
Every request or response consists of one or more whitespace-delimited
.Em words ,
followed by a line feed.
.It
The first word is the
.Em command word
and denotes the specific request or response in question.
.It
A command word in
.Em all lowercase
denotes a request; a command word in
.Em ALL CAPS
is a response.
.Nm
is case-sensitive.
.It
Words may contain backslashes, which
.Em escape
the next character, reproducing it verbatim.  This can be used to permit
whitespace characters, which would otherwise end the word.
.It
In addition, words may be
.Em quoted
in either
.Em double quotes ,
in which backslash escaping is respected, or
.Em single quotes ,
in which it is ignored.
.El
.\"-----------------------------
.Ss Controlling from a terminal
.\"-----------------------------
Since
.Nm
only speaks TCP/IP (by design), it can be difficult to speak with it from a
terminal on the local machine.  We recommend the use of a program such as
.Xr nc 1
to bridge this gap in functionality.
.\"
.\"==========
.Sh COMMANDS
.\"==========
.Nm
understands the following requests:
.Bl -tag -width "eject" -offset indent
.It eject
Unloads the current file, stopping playback if the file is playing.
.It load Ar path
Loads the file at
.Ar path .
.Ar path
.Em must
be an absolute path;
.Nm
performs no expansion or relative path searching.
.It play
Starts, or resumes, playback of the current file.
.It seek Ar position
Seeks to
.Ar position
microseconds after the start of the file.  A file can always be seeked.
Seeking past a file's end is equivalent to seeking to the end directly.
.It stop
Stops playback of the current file, keeping the current position.
.It quit
Quits
.Nm .
.El

In response to requests or other events,
.Nm
may produce the following:
.\"
.Bl -tag -width "END" -offset indent
.\"
.It END
The loaded file has reached its end of its own accord (not via a stop
command).
.\"
.It FAIL Ar reason
.Nm
failed to execute a command.  A human-readable
.Ar reason
is provided.
.\"
.It FEATURES Ar feature1 Op Ar feature2...
The set of BAPS3 feature flags
.Nm
implements.  This identifies the features
.Nm
provides to external clients.
.\"
.It FILE Ar path
The loaded file has changed to the file at
.Ar path .
.\"
.It OHAI Ar greeting
Sent at connection time;
.Ar greeting
identifies the playd server and version number.
.\"
.It OKAY Ar request
.Nm
just finished processing
.Ar request .
.\"
.It STATE Ar state
The playback state has changed to
.Ar state .
This may be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "Quitting" -offset indent
.It Ejected
No file is currently loaded.
.It Playing
A file is loaded and playing.
.It Quitting
.Nm
is preparing to shut down.
.It Stopped
A file is loaded, but is not playing.
.El
.\"
.It TIME Ar position
.Nm
periodically announces the current position in the file using TIME.
The
.Ar position
is in microseconds from the start of the file.
.\"
.It WHAT Ar message
.Nm
did not understand a command.  A human-readable
.Ar message
is provided.
.El
.\"
.\"==========
.Sh EXAMPLES
.\"==========
The command

.Dl % playd

will produce a listing similar to the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Analog (hw:0,0)
1: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Digital (hw:0,1)
2: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Alt Analog (hw:0,2)
3: HDA NVidia: ID 42 Digital (hw:1,3)
4: Plantronics GameCom 780: USB Audio (hw:2,0)
5: sysdefault
6: front
7: surround40
8: default
9: dmix
.Ed

Suppose we want
.Nm
to output on the GameCom.  The command

.Dl % playd 4

will start
.Nm
on its default address (localhost) and port, outputting on device ID 4.

If we should need more control over the address and port, we may supply them as
additional arguments, for example:

.Dl % playd 4 127.0.0.1 1350

To now connect to
.Nm
from the local terminal, one can use a command such as:

.Dl % nc 127.0.0.1 1350

An example session with
.Nm
may look like the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
-> OHAI 'playd v0.1.1'
-> FEATURES End FileLoad PlayStop Seek TimeReport
-> TIME 0
-> STATE Ejected
<- load '/usr/home/foo/awesome-mix.mp3'
-> OKAY load '/usr/home/foo/awesome-mix.mp3'
-> FILE '/usr/home/foo/awesome-mix.mp3'
-> STATE Stopped
<- play
-> OKAY play
-> STATE Playing
(file plays to end)
-> END
-> STATE Stopped
-> TIME 0
-> eject
<- OKAY eject
-> STATE Ejected
(disconnect)
.Ed

This hopefully covers all command-line usage of
.Nm .

.An Undefined behaviour if you try to escape (\*q\e\*q) a multi-byte UTF-8
character. This is intentional, for reasons of code simplicity.
