      <strong>URY playd</strong> is a minimalist audio player written in
      <a href="https://isocpp.org/" title="The Standard C++ web site.">C++11</a>.  It uses
      <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/libsox.html" title="The `libsox` SourceForge page.">libsox</a>,
      <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/" title="The PortAudio web site.">PortAudio</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv" title="The `libuv` GitHub page.">libuv</a>
      to decode audio, play it to any output device, and take commands via a
      simple, line-based TCP protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
      playd is part of the <strong>BAPS3</strong> project at
      <a href="http://ury.org.uk" title="The University Radio York web site.">University Radio York</a>.  It is under
      <em>active development</em>, and we can't yet guarantee it won't try to
      strangle your cat.

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
      playd doesn't have many features, as it's intended to be a minimal player
      core for use in bigger things.  Here are some features it <em>does</em>
      have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plays any file format supported by libsox;</li>
        <li>Selectable output device at launch-time;</li>
        <li>Play/Stop/Seek/Eject/Load commands;</li>
        <li>Text-based TCP/IP interface;</li>
        <li>
          Cross-platform: we've built it on Windows, FreeBSD, OS X, and some
          GNU/Linux distributions.
        </li>
      </ul>
