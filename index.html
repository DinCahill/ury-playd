<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p><strong>URY playd</strong> is a minimalist audio player written in <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++11</a>.  It
uses <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/libsox.html">libsox</a>, <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">libuv</a> to decode audio, play it
to any output device, and take commands via a simple, line-based
TCP protocol.</p>

<p>playd is part of the <strong>BAPS3</strong> project at <a href="http://ury.org.uk">University
Radio York</a>.  It is under <em>active development</em>, and we can&#39;t yet
guarantee it won&#39;t try to strangle your cat.</p>

<p>The latest release is <a href="__Edgware__">v0.2.0</a>; the documentation
hosted here refers to it.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>playd doesn&#39;t have many features, as it&#39;s intended to be a minimal
player core for use in bigger things.  Here are some features it
<em>does</em> have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plays any file format supported by libsox;</li>
<li>Selectable output device at launch-time;</li>
<li>Play/Stop/Seek/Eject/Load commands;</li>
<li>Text-based TCP/IP interface;</li>
<li>Cross-platform: we&#39;ve built it on Windows, FreeBSD, OS X, and
some GNU/Linux distributions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal</h2>

<p>playd itself is licensed under the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniversityRadioYork/ury-playd/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT licence</a>.  However, it
includes, and uses, code under other licences, including the LGPL.
A full build of playd is likely to come under the GPL, due to
optional sound library dependencies.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You can find the latest code, and instructions on how to use it,
at playd&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/ury-playd">GitHub</a> page.</p>
