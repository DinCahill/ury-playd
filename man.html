<p valign="top">is a very simple audio playback program,
intended to be driven by other, more complex software. Think
of it as but on a diet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">has a very simple
feature list: it can load one audio file (given its path),
it can play that file, it can pause playback of that file,
it can seek and eject that file, and it periodically sends
back the current position in that file. It is controlled via
a simple, line-of-text-based protocol exposed as a TCP
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If supplied with
zero arguments, enumerates the possible values for the
argument. Otherwise, it is launched according to the
provided arguments, the meaning of which is as follows: The
ID of the device onto which will output audio. This must be
one of the values provided when is executed with zero
arguments. Additionally, it must refer to a device capable
of audio output. If provided, this specifies the TCP/IP
address to which will bind when listening for client
connections. Typical values include 127.0.0.1 (connections
from localhost only) and 0.0.0.0 (connections from
anywhere). The default is 127.0.0.1. If provided, this
specifies the TCP/IP port on which will listen for client
connections. The default is 1350. speaks a text-based
protocol which is simple to understand but, for reasons of
brevity (and the fact that the protocol is not yet finalised
and may quickly outpace this man page in development), is
not documented here. Refer to
https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/ury-playd/wiki/playd-API
for the latest protocol documentation. Since only speaks
TCP/IP (by design), it can be difficult to speak with it
from a terminal on the local machine. We recommend the use
of a program such as to bridge this gap in functionality.
The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">will produce a
listing similar to the following: 0: HDA ATI SB: ALC892
Analog (hw:0,0) 1: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Digital (hw:0,1) 2:
HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Alt Analog (hw:0,2) 3: HDA NVidia: ID 42
Digital (hw:1,3) 4: Plantronics GameCom 780: USB Audio
(hw:2,0) 5: sysdefault 6: front 7: surround40 8: default 9:
dmix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Suppose we want to
output on the GameCom. The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">will start on its
default address (localhost) and port, outputting on device
ID 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If we should need
more control over the address and port, we may supply them
as additional arguments, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To now connect to
from the local terminal, one can use a command such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">This example,
hopefully, covers all command-line usage of Yes. See
https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/ury-playd/issues for
the issue tracker.</p>
